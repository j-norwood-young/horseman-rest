Horseman REST
=============

A RESTful server for PhantomJS via HorsemanJS and Restle

**Status: Very incomplete!**

Currently it can open and close PhantomJS, open tabs, get the status of the tabs, and run a text selector.

I may or may not work on it more, since I'm also testing [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) for the same purpose.

##Installing

- Download
- Run `npm install`
- Run the tests if you want, `npm test`
- Edit the config to set your port and Horseman settings, `config/default.json`
- Start the server, `npm start`
